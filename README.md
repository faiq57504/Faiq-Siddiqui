This program simulates a Parking Management System that handles vehicle parking records. It allows users to park Rikshaws, Cars, and Buses with respective charges. The system tracks the total number of vehicles, calculates parking fees, and provides options to view or delete the records. If the parking is full, it denies further entries.
